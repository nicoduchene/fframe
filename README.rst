FFrame
======

FFrame was a quick comparison between two algorithms.
One was extremely inefficient, and the second much faster!
The first I wrote was the inefficient one.
I can barely believe I wrote it.
The goal was to discretize a function's domain and image
given some allowed values.
After re-reading I realized I made a conceptual error
in the lut_method, and fixed it with the functional_method,
which is much faster as well.
